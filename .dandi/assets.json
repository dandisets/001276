"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240627_A2, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240627_A3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 6 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240627_B1, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240627_B3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 4 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240702_A1, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240702_A3, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 6 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240702_B1, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 4 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240702_B3, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 6 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240703_A1, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 6 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240703_B1, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240703_B2, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 4 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240703_B3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 6 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240813_A1, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  Control protocol (no canceling pulses applied),013: Protocol consisted 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240813_A3, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240813_B1, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 6 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240813_B2, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240813_B3, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 4 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240821_A2, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 6 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240821_A3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 4 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240827_A1, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240827_A2, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240827_B3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240918_B2, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  Control protocol (no canceling pulses applied),013: Protocol consisted 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240813_A1, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 1 time at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240813_A2, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240813_A3, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  Control protocol (no canceling pulses applied),013: Protocol consisted 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240821_A2, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240827_A1, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),013: Protocol consisted 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240827_A2, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.",

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240827_B1, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 6 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P2_20240827_B3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 4 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P3_20240813_A3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 4 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P3_20240813_B1, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  Control protocol (no canceling pulses applied),013: Protocol consisted 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P3_20240813_B3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P3_20240827_A1, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P3_20240827_A2, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  Control protocol (no canceling pulses applied),013: Protocol consisted 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P3_20240827_A3, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),013: Protocol consisted 9 packets of pulses delivered at 1Hz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.

"Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P3_20240827_B3, Fluorescent Channel: FITC, Phase: post (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 6 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 3.8 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (3.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1). Subsequently, 600 ns pulses at 75% amplitude were delivered simultaneously from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by pulses at the same amplitude from electrodes 1 and 3. This sequence was then repeated at 50% amplitude and, finally, at 25% amplitude from each electrode pair. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated nine times at a defined frequency. Upon completion of these nine repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 3, or 5 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode. Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake. In some experiments, two hours after exposure, Propidium Iodide (PI) was added, incubated for 15 minutes, then replaced with dye-free solution. PI uptake, detected via the Cy3 channel, was used to evaluate cell death following electroporation.
